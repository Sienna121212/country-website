    <p>
        Sitting upon a hilltop amid a large green forest stretching down its steep slopes, <br>
        Orava Castle most definitaly looks impressive, as vast green hills lie off in the far <br>
        distance, and the Orava River runs right below the castles cliff face. <br>

        One of the most beautiful castles in the whole of Slovakia, Orava Castle was built all the way <br>
        back in the 13th century <br>

        As each generation added its own touches and additions, the castle  shows off a variety of architectural styles <br>
        with Romanesque, Gothic, and Renaissance features all as wonderful examples. Its museum has some old <br>
        artifacts and archaeological findings that document its rich and facinating history. Throughout the many many <br>
        centuries that it has stood atop a cliff, the Orava Castle has never been conquered! itâ€™s quite easy to <br>
        see why once you pass through its many great gates, vast walls, and many defenses. <br>
