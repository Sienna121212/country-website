    <p>
        Lying at the center of what used to be an enormous caldera, Banská Štiavnica <br>
        is a fascinating city to explore! Much of its glorious wealth is from the rich <br>
        mineral deposits that were once found in the ground around the town a long time ago. <br>
        what used to be a mining town, this city has a magnificent historic center, with lots <br>
        of beautiful churches, palaces, and museums!
