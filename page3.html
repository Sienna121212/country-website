    <p>
        As home of the tallest mountains in the country, the High Tatras makes for some pretty unforgettable <br>
        hiking and rock climbing. while in winter, there are loads of great slopes and pistes to ski, sled, and <br>
        snowboard down.

        The high majestic mountain range really is a sight to see; its jagged rocky peaks exceeding 2,500 m above <br>
        sea level, and sparkling alpine lakes and meadows can be found tucked away among its many slopes and valleys. <br>
        
        The High Tatras are almost a national symbol! and the snow-capped Mount Krivan is the most distinctive peak. <br>
        Because of the breathtakingly beautiful landscapes, the mountain range positions itself perfectly to all different <br>
        types of outdoor activities. There are plenty of paths and trails for you to hike, cycle, or ski along, and the views <br>
        are beautiful and breathtaking!
